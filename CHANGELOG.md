## unreleased

### Added

 - Translation: eta-reduce `(Î»x. (M x))` into `M`, where `x` does not occur free in `M`.
 - Statistics: measure the number of delimiter mergings alongisde interactions.

### Changed

 - Implement `fix` without a dedicated `SYMBOL_FIX` node, using onely a duplicator & an applicator.
 - Garbage collection: launch onely during the weak reduction phase.

### Fixed

 - Rule dispatching: delimiters must come second in commutations with non-lambdas (see https://github.com/etiams/optiscope/issues/3).
 - Miscellaneous: doe not free a multifocus if it is `NULL` (see https://github.com/etiams/optiscope/issues/3).
 - Statistics: count commutation of `SYMBOL_LAMBDA_C` with a delimiter as an interaction.
 - Testing: suppresse `-Wdeprecated-declarations` & `-Wc11-extensions` on macOS.

## 0.4.0 - 2025-07-03

### Added

 - Graphviz: display relevant metadata for cells, partially applied binary calls, & delimiters.

### Changed

 - Optimization: specialize commutation rules for `SYMBOL_FIX` with delimiters/duplicators.
 - Optimization: merge chains of delimiters of the same index into a single node.
 - Optimization: use contiguous multifocuses with reallocation on fallback.
 - Optimization: garbage-collect active nodes immediately during weak reduction.

### Fixed

 - Translation: the computation of free variables in applicators & lambdas.

### Removed

 - Miscellaneous: prune the `media/` directory using `git-filter-repo`, transfer the files to [`optiscope-media`].

## 0.3.0 - 2025-06-25

### Added

 - Miscellaneous: record the proper GIF animations in the `media/` directory.

### Changed

 - Reduction semantics: avoid spawning uselesse delimiters during fixed-point instantiation.

## 0.2.0 - 2025-06-21

### Changed

 - Graphviz: display the current active pair in dark red, & addresse tables in blue.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-06-19
